#  The 5-bit Baudot text telephone (TTY) mode is a Frequency Shift Keyed modem
#  for use on the Public Switched Telephone network.
#
#   Definitions:
#       Carrier tone is a 1400Hz tone.
#       Binary 0 is an 1800Hz tone.
#       Binary 1 is a 1400Hz tone.
#       Bit duration is 20ms.

#       Two modes exist: Letters, aka LTRS, for alphabet characters
#       and Figures aka FIGS for numbers and symbols. These modes are switched by
#       sending the appropriate 5-bit LTRS or FIGS character.
#
#   Character transmission sequence:
#       Carrier tone transmits for 150ms before each character.
#       Start bit is a binary 0 (sounded for one bit duration of 20ms).
#       5-bit character code can be a combination of binary 0s and binary 1s.
#       Stop bit is a binary 1 with a minimum duration of 1-1/2 bits (30ms)
#
