TTY Adventure Game Parser


This is a simple text parser for text adventure games, designed to be compatible with 
TTY/TDD devices. It is made with the Ultratec Superprint 4425 in mind, but should theoretically
work with any TDD, or even over a terminal.

The main restrictions are:
- limit of 24 characters per line
- Reduced character set (both in and out)
- File size (due to running on a Pi Pico)
- low transfer speeds (45.5 baud!!)
