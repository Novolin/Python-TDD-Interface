HELLO THIS IS VERY, VERY, ***VERY*** BROKEN RIGHT NOW

I CAN'T PROPERLY TEST THINGS UNTIL SOME HARDWARE ARRIVES

IF THIS BRICKS YOUR SHIT OR MAKES YOUR HEARING EXPLODE, THAT'S ON YOUR

ALSO!!!!! DO NOT!!! EVER!!!!! PLUG THIS INTO A REAL-ASS TELEPHONE LINE!!!!

Phone lines ring at 90 Volts (!!!) You will, at best, fry your shit if you don't properly protect it

At worst, you'll get a potentially lethal shock. 

Somewhere inbetween the FCC/CRTC/Your local equivalent will show up and be very angry
