V0.04:
- Added direct playback support via simpleaudio
- Rewrote to object-based system, for easier switching between baud rates
- Began work for some kind of decoding system


V0.03a:
- Tweaked UI:
    Added text preview 
    Blocked saving blank files/filenames

V0.03:
- started tracking changes
- fixed FSK bit order
- reorganized file structure
- expanded on readme.md
    Audio Files:
- tweaked wave files for smoother playback
    -immediately negated change because I changed baud rate and it did the same thing
- renamed files to 1400.wav and 1800.wav since i kept confusing myself
- hopefully will implement proper waveform generation soon?
- Added 45.5/50 baud switching option
    GUI:
- Started writing it properly
- Added baud rate selection
